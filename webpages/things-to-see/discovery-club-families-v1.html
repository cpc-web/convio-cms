<p>Discover rocks, trees, soil, and squirrels in New York City&rsquo;s greatest outdoor classroom &ndash; Central Park! Woodlands Discovery Club for Families is the perfect adventure for families looking to get out of the house and explore a woodland without ever leaving the city. In each weekly two-hour session, families will learn together and connect with nature through hands-on science activities, using tools from your very own Discovery Kits! Activities are correlated to state and national learning standards.</p>

<p><strong>What can we expect in Woodlands Discovery Club for Families?</strong></p>
<p>Families explore the unique ecology of an urban park woodland through activities designed to promote collaborative learning through direct inquiry. Participants are given opportunities to practice their scientific and observational skills, to develop their social skills, and to express their learning creatively. The curriculum is correlated with Common Core speaking and listening standards and New York state science and social studies standards for grades 1-4. The learning in Discovery Club is cumulative, with each week focusing on a different woodland topic, guided by the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: What is Central Park?</li>
<li>Week 2: What is an urban park woodland?</li>
<li> Week 3: What grows in the North Woods?</li>
<li>Week 4: Who lives in the North Woods?</li>
<li>Week 5: How are we connected to the North Woods?</li>
</ul>
<p>Weekly emails provide an overview of each upcoming session, additional resources, and suggested at-home activities to help families make connections between home and the Park. The five-week program culminates with a special stewardship project in the Park. Through this experience, we hope participants will gain a deeper appreciation for the natural world, urban parks, and the vital role that we play as park stewards.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the program take place?</strong></p>
<p>Woodlands Discovery Club explores the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">North Woods</span> located in the northwest corner of Central Park from 101<sup>st</sup> to 110<sup>th</sup> Streets.&nbsp; Designed to include tumbling cascades, rustic bridges, and picturesque pools, the North Woods evokes the look and feel of the landscape of the Adirondack Mountains.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in a Discovery Kit?</strong></p>
<p>The Discovery Kit is a backpack that contains all the tools you&rsquo;ll need to fully investigate Central Park&rsquo;s woodlands: binoculars, a magnifying glass, field guides, and most importantly, a field notebook to record observations.&nbsp; Each participating child receives a Discovery Kit that is theirs to keep, allowing for continued exploration throughout Central Park&rsquo;s 843 acres or your own city block!</p>
<p><strong>What should we wear and bring?</strong></p>
<p>Woodlands Discovery Club takes place entirely outdoors; come prepared to explore the woodlands.&nbsp; Wear comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing and closed-toe shoes you don&rsquo;t mind getting dirty.&nbsp; You never know when you&rsquo;ll be on your hands and knees exploring the leaf litter with a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>The nearest water fountain is a hike, so bring along a water bottle to keep you hydrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discussions will take place between activities.&nbsp; This is a great time to munch on a light snack brought from home.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if there&rsquo;s bad weather?</strong></p>
<p>Nature happens. Exploring in the rain is just as fun as in the sun, so dress to get wet and muddy.&nbsp; Should severe weather conditions be expected, however, we will move the session indoors at the <a href="/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/charles-a-dana-discovery-center.html">Charles A. Dana Discovery Center</a>, located inside the Park at 110th Street between Fifth and Lenox Avenues.</p>
<p><strong>Can we make up a missed session?</strong></p>
<p>Woodlands Discovery Club is structured to explore a new topic each week, so we are unable to allow individual families to make up a missed session.</p>
<p><strong>What programs are offered for families with children who are not in grades 1-4?</strong></p>
<p>We invite you to join us in caring for the Park through our Keeping it Green for Families program, or attend our summer Family Performance Festival series! Please check <a href="/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/events/">our calendar</a> for upcoming events.</p>
